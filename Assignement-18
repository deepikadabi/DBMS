Maintaining the Integrity of your Data.
1) Create a table called Cityorders. This will contain the same onum, amt and snum
fields as the Orders table, and the same cnum and city fields as the Customers
table, so that each customer’s order will be entered into this table along with his
or her city. Onum will be the primary key of Cityorders. All of the fields in
Cityorders will be constrained to match the Customers and Orders tables. Assume
the parent keys in these tables already have the proper constraints.

	create table cityorders
	select onum, amt, snum, cunu, city
	from orders
	natural join customers;

	alter table cityorders add constraint onum_fk
	foreign key(onum) references orders(onum);
